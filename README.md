Project Title
This is the must have of any project. It is important to know what your project is going to be about and the title represents that.

Project Description
This is an important part of your project and what many developers and non-developers will look at. It is vital to have the most accurate and correct information. The description needs to be well written with no grammar errors and that is readable to users of multiple backgrounds. It is important to put some time and thought into writing the description of the project. It does not need to be long but needs to summarize the project. (What does your app do? What tech did you use?)

Table of Contents (Optional)
A table of contents is good if you have a lengthy README and can help users navigate to sections quickly but is not a must have.

Getting Started
This section typically is brief and will list the pre-requisites that the user must have in order to start using the project code. This section can be similar or be combined with the Installation section. (Ex: Must have node -v)

Installation
This is where you will list the full instructions for users on how they can install and start using your project. This should include multiple steps and have detailed descriptions and outcomes for users. It is important to take your time and write these steps as thoroughly as possible. This will help users a lot and will help prevent users from coming back and asking follow-up questions.

Other Instructions, Specifications, Attributes, or Project Info
This section(s) can include any other relevant project information. This can include information specific to a particular OS or Framework (Ex: Linux, React, etc). Certain projects have specific instructions and information that may need to have their own separate sections. As you develop your project you will get a better idea of what you need to include in your README and how to structure it.

Contributing
It is important to list all the names and information of the people who've contributed to the project. Be sure to include their GitHub Profile Name and any other social media they may want to have listed. There are some cool markdown contributing badges that I will list in the Good Resources below.

Acknowledgements
Similar to Contributing it is important to include all the sources that helped you complete this project. It's always good to give credit where credit is due.
